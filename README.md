G-Plus V2 is a revolutionary tool for server owners to quickly connect real, live clients for stress testing and script testing purposes. This will allow you to quickly connect multiple clients to one or multiple servers and control each of them with advanced options.

This is the new and improved version of V1. V1 was slow, clunky and unorganized. Another core issue was that it's just not very usable for all server owners due to the hard coded and hard to remove link to the mandatory discord bot. This version is no longer tailored towards the ease of access via the discord bot and more tailored towards advanced options for the control of clients.

In the previous version we utilized Sandboxie and other various forms to simulate multiple legitimate clients at once, however in the new version, we'll be skipping sandboxie altogether, increasing performance tenfold.

Because I don't feel like basically learning a whole new API for memory management in lua V2 will be rewritten in C++.

# Our Goals
Our goal with this project is to allow server owners to easily test scripts or servers with multiple clients at once, allowing the server owner to easily write instructions for each bot to complete.

Note: This tool is specifically made for stress testing servers you have permission to stress test.
