# G-Plus

Join our discord to follow the new version coming out [UPlus](https://discord.gg/j9NEbSc2rE)

GPlus was a side project of mine that I originally planned to sell but discontinued due to prices of garry's mod accounts. It's a botnet that allows the user to connect bots to a garry's mod server, it also comes with a discord bot to control them on a mass scale.

It was made in LUA and Node JS. I'm quite new to Node JS so the code is quite messy. Other than that, it works. Just make sure to fill out everything correctly, and make sure to make a .ENV file in discord_bot with this structure:
```env
BOT_TOKEN=""
CLIENT_ID=""
GUILD_ID=""
```

After that fill out the Globals.lua file. 

This project requires Sandboxie Plus.
